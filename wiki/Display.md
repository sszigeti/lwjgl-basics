This is a short snippet of code demonstrating a typical application life cycle in LWJGL. The code is pretty self-explanatory. You can find other examples on the [LWJGL wiki](http://www.lwjgl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page).

The source code is listed [at the end of the article](#Source).

### OpenGL Setup

We need to set up a few things in order for OpenGL to work correctly. Note that we are using static imports; this is a Java feature that allows is to omit the class name, and it proves very useful for OpenGL programming. In Eclipse you can import with wildcard `*` for convenience, and then click Ctrl + Shift + O to organize and auto-correct any imports.

Firstly, it's important to set up our OpenGL viewport to match the display size. We will also call this whenever the display is resized:
```java
glViewport(0, 0, Display.getWidth(), Display.getHeight());
```

Next, we can disable depth testing since most 2D games will not require this. A bit of info here: the depth buffer is used in 3D scenes to ensure that distant objects render correctly, and do not overlap with closer objects. 

In 2D games, we determine which sprites overlap others based on their *draw order* (i.e. sprite B is drawn after sprite A, therefore it will appear on top of sprite A). Some advanced 2D games may make use of the depth buffer for hardware-accelerated depth sorting, but we don't need to worry about that for now.

```java
glDisable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);
```

Next, we need to enable blending. This will be explained in more detail in another series.
Without this enabled, transparent sprites may not render as expected.

```java
glEnable(GL_BLEND);
glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);
```

We also set the "clear color" in our initialization. This is the color which GL will clear the 
screen to. Keep in mind that colors are specified in RGBA floats in the range 0.0 to 1.0, so here we are specifiying transparent black.
```java
glClearColor(0f, 0f, 0f, 0f);
```

Notice that OpenGL is a "static" and "state based" API. Generally speaking, the states we have set above will not change until we call them with a new parameter. So we don't need to call these methods every frame, unless something (like a 3rd party library) is interfering with our GL states.

### Game Loop

The game loop we have here is very basic. At a later point, you can return to it to implement some timing and interpolation,
such as in [this example](http://www.lwjgl.org/wiki/index.php?title=LWJGL_Basics_4_(Timing)). For now, we rely on LWJGL's
`Display.sync` method to cap the frame-rate at 60 frames per second. 

LWJGL uses double-buffering under the hood; we render to the "back buffer,"
then call `Display.update` to flip the buffers and show the result on screen. As you can see,
we clear the screen each frame with the following line:
```java
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
```

This will clear the screen to the color we specified earlier, transparent black.

The rest of the code should be relatively self-explanitory.
